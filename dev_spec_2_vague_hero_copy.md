# Vague hero copy — dev spec
Site: allbirds.com · Priority 2 · Urgent · Effort: Low (0.5-2 days)

## Problem
The hero headline 'Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.' is brand-speak that doesn't address the visitor's immediate need to find comfortable, sustainable shoes, and the CTAs 'SHOP MEN' and 'SHOP WOMEN' force an unnecessary gender choice before seeing products.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> H1: 'Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.' CTAs: 'SHOP MEN', 'SHOP WOMEN'

## Current state
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: The hero is feature-led and vague; it doesn't mention the key benefits (comfort, sustainability) in a way that resonates with a visitor's frustration of finding shoes that are both comfortable and eco-friendly. The CTAs force a gender selection, which may not be the visitor's primary intent.

## Required change
h1: Comfortable Shoes, Made from Natural Materials; cta: Shop All Shoes; notes: Plain-language headline that directly addresses the visitor's likely intent (comfort + sustainability). A single 'Shop All Shoes' CTA reduces friction and lets the visitor browse without committing to a gender.
